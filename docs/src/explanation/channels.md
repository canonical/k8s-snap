# Channels

Canonical Kubernetes uses the concept of `channels` to make sure you always get
the version of Kubernetes you are expecting, and that future upgrades can be
handled with minimum, if any, disruption.

## Choosing the right channel

When installing or updating Canonical Kubernetes you can (and should in most
cases) specify a channel. The channel specified is made up of two components;
the **track** and the **risk level**. 

The track will match the minor version of upstream Kubernetes. For example,
specifying the `1.30` track will match upstream releases of the same minor
version ("1.30.0", "1.30.1", "1.30.x" etc.). Releases of Canonical Kubernetes
closely follow the upstream releases and usually follow within 24 hours.

The 'risk level' component of the channel is one of the following:

- **`stable`**: Matches upstream stable releases
- **`candidate`**: Tracks upstream release candidate
- **`beta`**: Tracks upstream beta releases - expect bugs
- **`edge`**: Experimental release including upstream alpha releases

Note that for each track, not all risk levels are guranteed to be available.
For example, there may be a new upstream version in devlopment which only has
an `edge` level. For a mature release, there may no longer be any `beta` or
`edge`. In these cases, if you specify a risk level which has no releases for
that track the snap system will choose the closest available release with a
lower risk level. Whatever risk level specified is the **maximum** risk level
of the snap that will be installed - if you choose `candidate` you will never
get `edge` for example.

For all snaps, you can find out what channels are available by running the
`info` command, For example:

```bash
snap info k8s
```

## Updates and switching channels

Updates for upstream patch releases will happen automatically by default. For
example, if you have selected the channel `1.30/stable`, your snap will refresh
itself on the usual snap [refresh schedule]. These updates should not effect
the operation of Canonical Kubernetes.

To change the channel of an already installed snap, the `refresh` command can
be used:

```bash
sudo snap refresh k8s --channel=<new-channel>
```

```{warning}
Changing the channel of an installed snap could result in loss of service. Please
check any release notes or upgrade guides first!
```

## FAQ 

If you aren't familiar with the concept of channels, here are the answers to
some frequently asked questions.

### Which channel is right for me?

Choosing the most appropriate channel for your needs depends on a number of
factors. We can give some general guidance for the following cases:

- **I want to always be on the latest stable version matching a specific upstream K8s
release (recommended).** 

Specify the release, for example: `--channel=1.30/stable`.

- **I want to test-drive a pre-stable release**

Use `--channel=<next_release>/edge` for alpha releases.

Use `--channel=<next_release>/beta` for beta releases.

Use `--channel=<next_release>/candidate` for candidate releases.

- **I am waiting to test a bug fix on Canonical Kubernetes**

Use `--channel=<release>/edge`.

- **I am waiting for a bug fix from upstream Kubernetes**

Use `--channel=<release>/candidate`.
