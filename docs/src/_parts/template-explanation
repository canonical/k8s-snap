# Explanation docs template

> Explanations are for learning and understanding

There is no set format to an explanation document. Good examples consist of
easy to understand text and are quite frequently accompanied by diagrams.

## Diagrams

You can include a diagram as an image using the usual Markdown format:

The documentation also supports various diagrams-as-code options. We
prefer to use UML-style diagrams, but you can also use Mermaid or many
other types.

## Links

Explanations frequently include links to other documents. In particular, please
consider adding a section titled 'Further Reading' at the end to collate
related topics (internal or external).
