# Reference docs template

> Reference guides are technical descriptions of the machinery.

The reference section is distinct from the How to section in that it provides
information without demonstrating in any depth how that information is to be used.
What's the point of that?

Often users may need to check some information - "What release included support
for Xxxx?" or "What options can I supply to Yyyy". 

The reference section is also distinct from the explanation section in that it
does not attempt to give any detailed explanation of why this information
exists or how it is to be used.

Consider an application which deals with many different image formats. A useful
reference page would list the filetypes supported and maybe a list of common
file extensions and perhaps a brief decscription:

| FileType | Extensions | Notes                                              |
|----------|------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| TIFF     | .tif,.tiff | Tag Image File Format - lossless bitmaps           |
| JPEG     | .jpg,.jpeg | Compressed photo-quality images                    |
| PNG      | .png       | Portable Network Graphics -lossless bitmaps        |

This table gives some reference information. It doesn't try to tell you which
format to use. It doesn't explain in great detail the differences between them.
It doesn't guide you how to use them. It is simply a reference. You could use
it to check whether the application can import or export files in a particular
format.

## Presentation

As the reference guide is usually about collections of small piece of data,
there are some specific ways of formatting this information which can be useful

We have already seen the table style. In other situations it may be more
relevant to use a simple bullet list:


- TIFF (.tif,.tiff)
- PNG (.png)
- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)

Or definition lists:


TIFF
: Tag Image File Format

JPEG
: Joint Photographic Experts Group

## Automation

For some types of information it may be more expedient to generate details or
text automatically through a script. there are a few ways this can then be used
in documentation.

For example, in the command reference we use:

```{include} ../../_parts/commands/k8s_config.md
   :end-before: '### SEE ALSO'
```
which automatically includes the contents of the file (note you can also use a
simple :start-after: and :end-before: option to filter out parts of the
original)

Pages can filter information from other sources to, for example:

``` {csv-table} Canonical Kubernetes public roadmap
   :file: ../../assets/roadmap.csv
   :widths: 30, 30
   :header-rows: 1
```

This defines an input from a CSV file.

## Tips

- Remember this is about presenting information.
- People are unlikely to read the entire page in one go - use headings, lists,
  tables etc to direct them to the information they are looking for.
- Resist the temptation to over-explain, but do provide links to documents which do!
