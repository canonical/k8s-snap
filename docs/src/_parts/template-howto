# How to use default DNS

Canonical Kubernetes includes a default DNS (Domain Name System) which is
essential for internal cluster communication. When enabled, the DNS facilitates
service discovery by assigning each service a DNS name. When disabled, you can
integrate a custom DNS solution into your cluster.

## What you'll need

This guide assumes the following:

- You have root or sudo access to the machine.
- You have a bootstrapped Canonical Kubernetes cluster (see the [Getting
  Started][getting-started-guide] guide).

> Proceed with clearly labelled steps. N.B. Use 'imperatives' rather than
> gerunds ('Enable XXX' rather than 'Enabling XXX', 'Check' rather than
> 'Checking')

## Check DNS status

> ALWAYS have some text directly after each heading

Find out whether DNS is enabled or disabled with the following command:


> Commands are identified by three backticks to start and end the sequence. No
> need to specify a code type for normal bash commands. DO NOT include '#' or
> '$' prompts

> ALWAYS separate input and output

```
sudo k8s status
```

> Proceed with steps until the task is complete. Consider whether links to related
> Guides or resources are appropriate
