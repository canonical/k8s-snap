# Tutorial docs template

> Tutorials are explained guides which fulfil the objectives of learning and
understanding through example.

>Unlike some of the other documentation types, tutorials are structured and easy
to provide a definitive template.

> Tutorials should start with a short introductory statement outlining the
objective of the tutorial. For example:

Installing Canonical Kubernetes should only take a few minutes. This tutorial
explains how to install the snap package and some typical operations. 

> For lengthier tutorials, it is worth considering adding a bullet list
detailing this:

## What you will learn

- How to install the k8s snap
- Configuring storage
- Deploying an application to the cluster
- Removing an application
- Turning off the cluster

> Next, ALL tutorials should include a section called 'What you will need'. This
> is a list (with links if necessary) that covers the requirements to start the
> tutorial. This could include things like system requirements, assumptions about
> software already installed and even knowledge. This is essentially the list of
> assumptions we are making

## What you will need

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or 20.04 LTS
- At least 20G disk space and 4G of memory
- The [Juju-client]

> The tutorial should proceed with numbered steps if possible, showing the
> sequence of the tutorial.

### 1. Install Canonical Kubernetes

Install the Canonical Kubernetes snap with:

```
sudo snap install k8s --edge --classic
```

> Remember this is a tutorial. It is fine to add words to explain what is going
on, why we are doing particular things, and what results one might expect. In
some cases you may even want to deliberately manufacture an error to better
illustrate how things work and how to solve problems.

> It is often a good idea to include a summarising statement at the end,
detailing the things the reader should now know about. This isn't entirely a
self-congratulatory exercise - it is an aid to learning an retention. It
doesn't have to be long or detailed. For example:

---

Congratulations you have now completed the tutorial. We found out how to
install the Kubernetes snap, how to change the configuration, deploy a
workload and remove everything again!

> Almost without exception you will then want to point the reader to other
> tutorials or how to guides. Please include a "Next Steps" heading with a list
> of links.

- Configure storage options [Storage]
- Master Kubernetes networking concepts: [Networking]
- Discover how to enable and configure Ingress resources [Ingress]

> Note that the links throughout should always be by reference. Your document
should end with a list of these links. This makes it 2000 times easier to
maintain the document and update the links when necessary!

Note the different type of links:

- for pages in the same category, you can just use the name (not including the
  file extension)
- for pages in a different category, it is better to use the full path(relative
  to the /docs/src/)
- external links are straightforward
