The {{product}} charm, `k8s`, is an operator: software which wraps an
application and contains all of the instructions necessary for deploying,
configuring, scaling, integrating the application on any cloud supported by
[Juju][].

The `k8s` charm takes care of installing and configuring the [k8s snap
package][] on cloud instances managed by Juju. Operating Kubernetes through
this charm makes it significantly easier to manage at scale, on remote cloud
instances and also to integrate other operators to enhance or customise your
Kubernetes deployment. You can find out more about {{product}} on this
[overview page][] or see a more detailed explanation in our [architecture
documentation][arch].
