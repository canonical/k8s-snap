# {{product}} charms

{{product}} can be deployed via [Juju][] with the following charms:

- **k8s**, which deploys a complete Kubernetes implementation
- **k8s-worker**, which deploys Kubernetes without the control plane for units
  intended as workers in a cluster (at least one `k8s` charm must be deployed
  and integrated with the worker for it to function)

## Charmhub

Both of the above charms are published to Charmhub.
