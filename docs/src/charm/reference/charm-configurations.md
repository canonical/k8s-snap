# Charm configuration options reference

This reference section details the configuration options available for the
`k8s` and `k8s-worker` charms. These options can be set at various points
during the charm's lifecycle. Some options are limited to the bootstrap
process, while others can be modified at any time. Options restricted to
bootstrap are explicitly noted in their descriptions and prefixed with
`bootstrap-`.
