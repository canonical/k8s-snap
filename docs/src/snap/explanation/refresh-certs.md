# Certificate Refreshes in Kubernetes

## What Are Certificates in Kubernetes?

Certificates are a crucial part of Kubernetes' security infrastructure, serving
to authenticate and secure communication within the cluster. They play a key
role in ensuring that communication between various components (such as the
API server, kubelets, and the datastore) is both encrypted and restricted to
authorized components only.

In Kubernetes, [X.509][] certificates are primarily used for
[Transport Layer Security][] (TLS), securing the communication between the
cluster's components.

## What Is a Certificate Refresh?

A certificate refresh in {{product}} refers to the process of renewing or
rotating certificates before they expire. Kubernetes certificates have
a specific validity period, after which they expire and are no longer
considered valid. If an expired certificate is used, it can lead to failures
in communication between cluster components, potentially disrupting the entire
cluster functionality.

Certificate refreshes ensure that the certificates in use are always valid and
secure, preventing unauthorized access or communication failures due to expired
certificates.

## Why Refreshing Certificates Is Important

### Maintaining Cluster Security

Certificates play a critical role in securing Kubernetes clusters by ensuring
that communication between components are encrypted and authenticated. When
a certificate expires, if not promptly renewed, it can leave the cluster
vulnerable to security risks. An expired certificate may not be able to
establish secure communication, potentially exposing the cluster to
unauthorized access.

Regular certificate refreshes mitigate this risk by ensuring that only valid
certificates are used, maintaining the security of the cluster.

### Preventing Downtime

As previously mentioned, Kubernetes relies on certificates for internal
communication between components. If these certificates expire and are not
renewed, critical components like kubelet, API server, or the datastore may
fail to communicate, leading to operational issues such as cluster downtime
or disruptions to specific workloads.

Proactively refreshing certificates before they expire ensures that Kubernetes
maintains continuous and uninterrupted operation of the cluster its workloads.

### Security Compliance

Security standards, such as [CIS][], often require the regular rotation of
credentials, including certificates. Periodically renewing Kubernetes
certificates not only aligns with best practices for security and
organizational policies but also ensures that the cluster meets security
standards and compliance requirements.
