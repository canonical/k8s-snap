## Other documentation types

If you are just getting started, the [Tutorials section] contains
step-by-step tutorials to help guide you through exploring and using
{{product}}.

If you have a specific goal our [How-to guides] have more in-depth
detail than tutorials and can be applied to a broader set of applications.
They’ll help you achieve an end-result but may require you to understand and
adapt the steps to fit your specific requirements.

Finally, our [Reference section] is for when you need to check specific
details or information such as the command reference or release notes.
