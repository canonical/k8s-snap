# CIS Hardening 

CIS Hardening refers to the process of implementing security configurations that
align with the benchmarks set forth by the [Center for Internet Security] (CIS).
These [benchmarks] are a set of best practices and guidelines designed to secure
various software and hardware systems, including Kubernetes clusters. The 
primary goal of CIS hardening is to reduce the attack surface and enhance the 
overall security posture of an environment by enforcing configurations that are
known to protect against common vulnerabilities and threats.

## Why is CIS Hardening Important for Kubernetes?

Kubernetes, by its nature, is a complex system with many components interacting 
in a distributed environment. This complexity can introduce numerous security 
risks if not properly managed such as unauthorised access, data breaches and 
service disruption. CIS hardening for Kubernetes focuses on configuring various
components of a Kubernetes cluster to meet the security standards specified in 
the [CIS Kubernetes Benchmark].
