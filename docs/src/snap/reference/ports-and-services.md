# Services and ports

## Network Services

There are two main types of services based on the network interface they use:

* Default Host Interface Services: These services bind to the default host 
interface, making them accessible from outside the host.
* Localhost Services: These services bind to the localhost interface,
meaning they can only be accessed from within the host.
