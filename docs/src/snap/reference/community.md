# Welcome to the {{product}} community

This rapidly growing community is a diverse bunch of people - developers,
Kubernetes admins, inventors, researchers, students… and we all share the joy
of a reliable, flexible, secure, timely version of upstream Kubernetes. The
team recognise the important role each and every user plays in the success of
the project as a whole and how valuable your contributions are.

## Do you have questions?

Do you have questions about {{product}}? Perhaps you want some ideas
on how to best achieve a certain goal or maybe some aspect of your Kubernetes
doesn't behave the way you expect. Perhaps you'd just like some advice from
more experienced users. There are a number of ways to get in touch:

- Using the [Kubernetes slack][slack]: find us in the #canonical-kubernetes channel
- In the public [Matrix room][matrix]
- On the [Ubuntu Discourse][discourse]

For more formal support, please see the support options available to you on the
[Ubuntu website][support].

**Our commitment to you** - we may not always be able to answer your questions,
but we promise to respond within three working days.

## Found a bug?

You can always track what is going on with development by watching our GitHub
repository. This is also the best place to file a bug if you find
one, or of course you are also welcome to contribute to the code.

**Our commitment to you** - we monitor the issues on GitHub regularly and we
aim to triage all bug reports within three working days.

## Contributing to the code?

{{product}} is proudly open source, published under the GPLv3 license.
We welcome and encourage contributions to the code. Please see the [Developer
guide] for more information on contributing.

**Our commitment to you** - we closely follow activity on the source
repository. We aim to respond to any PRs within three working days.

## Contributing to docs?

Our documentation is extremely important to us and is actively maintained by
the entire team. That doesn't mean that it can't be improved though. Every page
in the documentation has an "Edit this page" link in the top right which takes
you to GitHub to make small changes. For larger contributions, please see the
[Contributing guide].

**Our commitment to you**: Comments are usually read daily and we are really
grateful for docs improvements.

## Code of conduct

Building a fair, open and inclusive community is important to us. We think
adopting a code of conduct is a sensible way to make sure that everybody
participating understands what the expectations and obligations are. The team
adopts the [Ubuntu Code of Conduct
2.0](https://ubuntu.com/community/ethos/code-of-conduct), and we use these as
the guidelines for participation.
