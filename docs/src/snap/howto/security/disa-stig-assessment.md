# DISA STIG for {{product}}

Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) are developed by the Defense
Information System Agency (DISA) for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD).

The [Kubernetes STIG] contains guidelines on how to check and remediate various
potential security concerns for a Kubernetes deployment.

{{product}} aligns with many DISA STIG compliance recommendations by default.
However, additional hardening steps are required to fully meet the standard.

## What you'll need

This guide assumes the following:

- You have a bootstrapped {{product}} cluster (see the [getting started] guide)
- You have root or sudo access to the machine
- You have reviewed the [post-deployment hardening] guide and have applied the
  hardening steps that are relevant to your use-case

**Automated**: An automated process can be used to validate that the system is
correctly configured.

**Not Applicable**: These findings are not applicable to {{product}}. Some
reasons for this include: a check on a Kubernetes feature that was removed
prior to {{product}}'s first release, a check for a component that {{product}}
does not package, etc.

**Manual**: These checks require manual intervention from a cluster
administrator, so they cannot be automated.

### [V-242381]: The Kubernetes Controller Manager must create unique service accounts for each work payload

#### Severity: High

#### Status: Automated

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> The Kubernetes Controller Manager is a background process that embeds core
> control loops regulating cluster system state through the API Server. Every
> process executed in a pod has an associated service account. By default,
> service accounts use the same credentials for authentication. Implementing
> the default settings poses a High risk to the Kubernetes Controller Manager.
> Setting the "--use-service-account-credential" value lowers the attack
> surface by generating unique service accounts settings for each controller
> instance.


#### Comments:

> The command line arguments of the Kubernetes Controller Manager in the
> k8s-snap are defined in the following file:
>
>     /var/snap/k8s/common/args/kube-controller-manager
>


#### Remediation

Edit `/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kube-controller-manager` in order to set the
argument `--use-service-account-credentials` for service
`kube-controller-manager` as appropriate.

Ensure it is set to one of: `true`, `1`

Afterwards restart the `kube-controller-manager` service with:



    sudo systemctl restart snap.k8s.kube-controller-manager



#### Auditing (as root)

Ensure that the argument `--use-service-account-credentials` for service
`kube-controller-manager` is set as appropriate in the service's argument file
`/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kube-controller-manager`.

```bash
grep -E -q  '\-\-use-service-account-credentials=(true|1)' '/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kube-controller-manager'
test $? -eq 0 && echo PASS || echo FAIL
```

In the default configuration of the `k8s-snap`, resulting output lines will
start with `PASS`.

The final line of the output will be `PASS`.



### [V-242383]: User-managed resources must be created in dedicated namespaces

#### Severity: High

#### Status: Manual

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> Creating namespaces for user-managed resources is important when implementing
> Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC). RBAC allows for the authorization of users
> and helps support proper API server permissions separation and network micro
> segmentation. If user-managed resources are placed within the default
> namespaces, it becomes impossible to implement policies for RBAC permission,
> service account usage, network policies, and more.





#### Comments:

> The Kubernetes System Administrators must manually inspect the services in
> all of the default namespaces to ensure there are no user-created resources
> within them:
>
>     kubectl -n default get all | grep -v "^(service|NAME)"
>     kubectl -n kube-public get all | grep -v "^(service|NAME)"
>     kubectl -n kube-node-lease get all | grep -v "^(service|NAME)"
>



### [V-242386]: The Kubernetes API server must have the insecure port flag disabled

#### Severity: High

#### Status: Not Applicable

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> By default, the API server will listen on two ports. One port is the secure
> port and the other port is called the "localhost port". This port is also
> called the "insecure port", port 8080. Any requests to this port bypass
> authentication and authorization checks. If this port is left open, anyone
> who gains access to the host on which the Control Plane is running can bypass
> all authorization and authentication mechanisms put in place, and have full
> control over the entire cluster.
>
> Close the insecure port by setting the API server's "--insecure-port" flag to
> "0", ensuring that the "--insecure-bind-address" is not set.





#### Comments:

> This Finding refers to the `--insecure-port` command line argument for the
> Kubernetes API Server service.
>
> Support for the `--insecure-port` flag has been deprecated in Kubernetes
> 1.10, and completely removed in 1.21, so this Finding is Not Applicable to
> any versions of the k8s-snap.
>
> https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/91506
>



### [V-242387]: The Kubernetes Kubelet must have the "readOnlyPort" flag disabled

#### Severity: High

#### Status: Automated

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> Kubelet serves a small REST API with read access to port 10255. The read-only
> port for Kubernetes provides no authentication or authorization security
> control. Providing unrestricted access on port 10255 exposes Kubernetes pods
> and containers to malicious attacks or compromise. Port 10255 is deprecated
> and should be disabled.





#### Comments:

> The k8s-snap does not pass a `--config` command line argument to the Kubelet
> service, but does explicitly pass `--read-only-port=0` as a command line
> argument.
>
> The command line arguments of Kubelet in the k8s-snap are defined in the
> following file:
>
>     /var/snap/k8s/common/args/kubelet
>


#### Remediation

Edit `/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kubelet` in order to set the argument
`--read-only-port` for service `kubelet` as appropriate.

Ensure it is set to: `0`

Afterwards restart the `kubelet` service with:



    sudo systemctl restart snap.k8s.kubelet



#### Auditing (as root)

Ensure that the argument `--read-only-port` for service `kubelet` is set as
appropriate in the service's argument file `/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kubelet`.

Note: this Finding allows for this argument to be UNSET as well.

```bash
grep -E -q  '\-\-read-only-port=(0)' '/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kubelet' || echo UNSET
test $? -eq 0 && echo PASS || echo FAIL
```

In the default configuration of the `k8s-snap`, resulting output lines will
start with `PASS`.

The final line of the output will be `PASS`.



### [V-242388]: The Kubernetes API server must have the insecure bind address not set

#### Severity: High

#### Status: Automated

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> By default, the API server will listen on two ports and addresses. One
> address is the secure address and the other address is called the "insecure
> bind" address and is set by default to localhost. Any requests to this
> address bypass authentication and authorization checks. If this insecure bind
> address is set to localhost, anyone who gains access to the host on which the
> Control Plane is running can bypass all authorization and authentication
> mechanisms put in place and have full control over the entire cluster.
>
> Close or set the insecure bind address by setting the API server's
> "--insecure-bind-address" flag to an IP or leave it unset and ensure that the
> "--insecure-bind-port" is not set.





#### Comments:

> The command line arguments of the Kubernetes API Server in the k8s-snap are
> defined in the following file:
>
>     /var/snap/k8s/common/args/kube-apiserver
>


#### Remediation

Edit `/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kube-apiserver` in order to set the argument
`--insecure-bind-address` for service `kube-apiserver` as appropriate.

Ensure it is NOT set to any value.

Afterwards restart the `kube-apiserver` service with:



    sudo systemctl restart snap.k8s.kube-apiserver



#### Auditing (as root)

Ensure that the argument `--insecure-bind-address` for service `kube-apiserver`
is set as appropriate in the service's argument file
`/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kube-apiserver`.

Note: this Finding allows for this argument to be UNSET as well.

```bash
grep -E -qvz '\-\-insecure-bind-address=(.*)' '/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kube-apiserver' && echo UNSET
test $? -eq 0 && echo PASS || echo FAIL
```

In the default configuration of the `k8s-snap`, resulting output lines will
start with `UNSET`.

The final line of the output will be `PASS`.



### [V-242390]: The Kubernetes API server must have anonymous authentication disabled

#### Severity: High

#### Status: Automated

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> The Kubernetes API Server controls Kubernetes via an API interface. A user
> who has access to the API essentially has root access to the entire
> Kubernetes cluster. To control access, users must be authenticated and
> authorized. By allowing anonymous connections, the controls put in place to
> secure the API can be bypassed.
>
> Setting "--anonymous-auth" to "false" also disables unauthenticated requests
> from kubelets.
>
> While there are instances where anonymous connections may be needed (e.g.,
> health checks) and Role-Based Access Controls (RBACs) are in place to limit
> the anonymous access, this access should be disabled, and only enabled when
> necessary.





#### Comments:

> The command line arguments of the Kubernetes API Server in the k8s-snap are
> defined in the following file:
>
>     /var/snap/k8s/common/args/kube-apiserver
>


#### Remediation

Edit `/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kube-apiserver` in order to set the argument
`--anonymous-auth` for service `kube-apiserver` as appropriate.

Ensure it is set to one of: `false`, `0`

    sudo systemctl restart snap.k8s.kube-apiserver



#### Auditing (as root)

Ensure that the argument `--anonymous-auth` for service `kube-apiserver` is set
as appropriate in the service's argument file
`/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kube-apiserver`.

```bash
grep -E -q  '\-\-anonymous-auth=(false|0)' '/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kube-apiserver'
test $? -eq 0 && echo PASS || echo FAIL
```

The final line of the output will be `PASS`.



### [V-242391]: The Kubernetes Kubelet must have anonymous authentication disabled

#### Severity: High

#### Status: Automated

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> A user who has access to the Kubelet essentially has root access to the nodes
> contained within the Kubernetes Control Plane. To control access, users must
> be authenticated and authorized. By allowing anonymous connections, the
> controls put in place to secure the Kubelet can be bypassed.
>
> Setting anonymous authentication to "false" also disables unauthenticated
> requests from kubelets.
>
> While there are instances where anonymous connections may be needed (e.g.,
> health checks) and Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC) are in place to limit
> the anonymous access, this access must be disabled and only enabled when
> necessary.





#### Comments:

> service, but does explicitly pass `--anonymous-auth=0` as a command line
> argument.
>
> The command line arguments of Kubelet in the k8s-snap are defined in the
> following file:

#### Remediation

Edit `/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kubelet` in order to set the argument
`--anonymous-auth` for service `kubelet` as appropriate.

Ensure it is set to one of: `false`, `0`

Afterwards restart the `kubelet` service with:



    sudo systemctl restart snap.k8s.kubelet



#### Auditing (as root)

Ensure that the argument `--anonymous-auth` for service `kubelet` is set as
appropriate in the service's argument file `/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kubelet`.

```bash
grep -E -q  '\-\-anonymous-auth=(false|0)' '/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kubelet'
test $? -eq 0 && echo PASS || echo FAIL
```

In the default configuration of the `k8s-snap`, resulting output lines will
start with `PASS`.

The final line of the output will be `PASS`.



### [V-242392]: The Kubernetes kubelet must enable explicit authorization

#### Severity: High

#### Status: Automated

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> Kubelet is the primary agent on each node. The API server communicates with
> each kubelet to perform tasks such as starting/stopping pods. By default,
> kubelets allow all authenticated requests, even anonymous ones, without
> requiring any authorization checks from the API server. This default behavior
> bypasses any authorization controls put in place to limit what users may
> perform within the Kubernetes cluster. To change this behavior, the default
> setting of AlwaysAllow for the authorization mode must be set to "Webhook".





#### Comments:

> The k8s-snap does not pass a `--config` command line argument to the Kubelet
> service, but does explicitly pass `--authorization-mode=Webhook` as a command
> line argument.
>
> The command line arguments of Kubelet in the k8s-snap are defined in the
> following file:
>
>     /var/snap/k8s/common/args/kubelet
>


#### Remediation

Edit `/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kubelet` in order to set the argument
`--authorization-mode` for service `kubelet` as appropriate.

Ensure it is set to: `Webhook`

Afterwards restart the `kubelet` service with:



    sudo systemctl restart snap.k8s.kubelet



#### Auditing (as root)

Ensure that the argument `--authorization-mode` for service `kubelet` is set as
appropriate in the service's argument file `/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kubelet`.

Note: this Finding allows for this argument to be UNSET as well.

```bash
grep -E -q  '\-\-authorization-mode=(Webhook)' '/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kubelet' || echo UNSET
test $? -eq 0 && echo PASS || echo FAIL
```

In the default configuration of the `k8s-snap`, resulting output lines will
start with `UNSET`.

The final line of the output will be `PASS`.



### [V-242397]: The Kubernetes kubelet staticPodPath must not enable static pods

#### Severity: High

#### Status: Automated

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> Allowing kubelet to set a staticPodPath gives containers with root access
> permissions to traverse the hosting filesystem. The danger comes when the
> container can create a manifest file within the /etc/kubernetes/manifests
> directory. When a manifest is created within this directory, containers are
> entirely governed by the Kubelet not the API Server. The container is not
> susceptible to admission control at all. Any containers or pods that are
> instantiated in this manner are called "static pods" and are meant to be used
> for pods such as the API server, scheduler, controller, etc., not workload
> pods that need to be governed by the API Server.





#### Comments:

> The Finding refers to checking the 'staticPodPath' in kubectl's `--config`
> file is not set.
>
> The k8s-snap does not pass a `--config` command line argument to the Kubelet
> service, nor does it pass `--pod-manifest-path` as a command line argument.
>
> The command line arguments of Kubelet in the k8s-snap are defined in the
> following file:
>
>     /var/snap/k8s/common/args/kubelet
>


#### Remediation

Edit `/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kubelet` in order to set the argument
`--pod-manifest-path` for service `kubelet` as appropriate.

Ensure it is NOT set to any value.

Afterwards restart the `kubelet` service with:



    sudo systemctl restart snap.k8s.kubelet



#### Auditing (as root)

Ensure that the argument `--pod-manifest-path` for service `kubelet` is set as
appropriate in the service's argument file `/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kubelet`.

Note: this Finding allows for this argument to be UNSET as well.

```bash
grep -E -qvz '\-\-pod-manifest-path=(.*)' '/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kubelet' && echo UNSET
test $? -eq 0 && echo PASS || echo FAIL
```

In the default configuration of the `k8s-snap`, resulting output lines will
start with `UNSET`.

The final line of the output will be `PASS`.



### [V-242415]: Secrets in Kubernetes must not be stored as environment variables

#### Severity: High

#### Status: Manual

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> Secrets, such as passwords, keys, tokens, and certificates should not be
> stored as environment variables. These environment variables are accessible
> inside Kubernetes by the "Get Pod" API call, and by any system, such as CI/CD
> pipeline, which has access to the definition file of the container. Secrets
> must be mounted from files or stored within password vaults.





#### Comments:

> The Kubernetes System Administrator must manually inspect the Environment of
> each user-created Pod to ensure there are no Pods passing information which
> the System Administrator may categorize as 'sensitive' (e.g. passwords,
> cryptographic keys, API tokens, etc).
>



### [V-242434]: Kubernetes Kubelet must enable kernel protection

#### Severity: High

#### Status: Automated

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> System kernel is responsible for memory, disk, and task management. The
> kernel provides a gateway between the system hardware and software.
> Kubernetes requires kernel access to allocate resources to the Control Plane.
> Threat actors that penetrate the system kernel can inject malicious code or
> hijack the Kubernetes architecture. It is vital to implement protections
> through Kubernetes components to reduce the attack surface.


#### Comments:

> The Finding stipulates that `--protect-kernel-defaults` must be set on the
> Kubelet service.
>
> This flag is not set by default in the k8s-snap, as it may prevent kubelet
> from starting normally unless the kernel settings are as Kubelet expects.
>
> Please review the hardening guide for information on how to properly
> configure the Node's Operating System for Kubelet.
>
> <!-- TODO: link to dedicated K8s hardening doc. -->
> https://microk8s.io/docs/how-to-cis-harden#check-426

```

In the default configuration of the `k8s-snap`, resulting output lines will
start with `UNSET`.

The final line of the output will be `PASS`.



### [V-242436]: The Kubernetes API server must have the ValidatingAdmissionWebhook enabled

#### Severity: High

#### Status: Automated

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> Enabling the admissions webhook allows for Kubernetes to apply policies
> against objects that are to be created, read, updated, or deleted. By
> applying a pod security policy, control can be given to not allow images to
> be instantiated that run as the root user. If pods run as the root user, the
> pod then has root privileges to the host system and all the resources it has.
> An attacker can use this to attack the Kubernetes cluster. By implementing a
> policy that does not allow root or privileged pods, the pod users are limited
> in what the pod can do and access.





#### Comments:

> This Finding stipulates that the `ValidatingAdmissionWebhook` Admission
> Plugin should be enabled.
>
> The `ValidatingAdmissionWebhook` Admission Plugin is enabled by default in
> all modern versions of the k8s-snap.
>
> The automated check associated with this Finding is thus meant to verify that
> `ValidatingAdmissionWebhook` is NOT disabled through the
> `--disable-admission-plugins` argument.
>


#### Remediation

Edit `/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kube-apiserver` in order to set the argument
`--disable-admission-plugins` for service `kube-apiserver` as appropriate.

### [V-245542]: Kubernetes API Server must disable basic authentication to protect information in transit

#### Severity: High

#### Status: Automated

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> Kubernetes basic authentication sends and receives request containing
> username, uid, groups, and other fields over a clear text HTTP communication.
> Basic authentication does not provide any security mechanisms using
> encryption standards. PKI certificate-based authentication must be set over a
> secure channel to ensure confidentiality and integrity. Basic authentication
> must not be set in the manifest file.





#### Comments:

> The command line arguments of the Kubernetes API Server in the k8s-snap are

The final line of the output will be `PASS`.



### [V-245543]: Kubernetes API Server must disable token authentication to protect information in transit

#### Severity: High

#### Status: Automated

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> Kubernetes token authentication uses password known as secrets in a plain
> text file. This file contains sensitive information such as token, username
> and user uid. This token is used by service accounts within pods to
> authenticate with the API Server. This information is very valuable for
> attackers with malicious intent if the service account is privileged having
> access to the token. With this token a threat actor can impersonate the
> service account gaining access to the Rest API service.





#### Comments:

> The command line arguments of the Kubernetes API Server in the k8s-snap are
> defined in the following file:

#### Severity: High

#### Status: Automated

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> Kubernetes control plane and external communication is managed by API Server.
> The main implementation of the API Server is to manage hardware resources for
> pods and container using horizontal or vertical scaling. Anyone who can gain
> access to the API Server can effectively control your Kubernetes
> architecture. Using authenticity protection, the communication can be
> protected against man-in-the-middle attacks/session hijacking and the
> insertion of false information into sessions.
>
> The communication session is protected by utilizing transport encryption
> protocols, such as TLS. TLS provides the Kubernetes API Server with a means
> to be able to authenticate sessions and encrypt traffic.
>
> By default, the API Server does not authenticate to the kubelet HTTPs
> endpoint. To enable secure communication for API Server, the parameter
> -kubelet-client-certificate and kubelet-client-key must be set. This
> parameter gives the location of the certificate and key pair used to secure
> API Server communication.

### [V-242396]: Kubernetes Kubectl cp command must give expected access and results

#### Severity: Medium

#### Status: Not Applicable

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> One of the tools heavily used to interact with containers in the Kubernetes
> cluster is kubectl. The command is the tool System Administrators used to

### [V-242398]: Kubernetes DynamicAuditing must not be enabled

#### Severity: Medium

#### Status: Not Applicable

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> Protecting the audit data from change or deletion is important when an attack
> occurs. One way an attacker can cover their tracks is to change or delete
> audit records. This will either make the attack unnoticeable or make it more
> difficult to investigate how the attack took place and what changes were
> made. The audit data can be protected through audit log file protections and
> user authorization.
>
> One way for an attacker to thwart these measures is to send the audit logs to
> another source and filter the audited results before sending them on to the
> original target. This can be done in Kubernetes through the configuration of
> dynamic audit webhooks through the DynamicAuditing flag.





#### Comments:

> This finding relates to the `--feature-gate=DynamicAuditing` feature gate

### [V-242399]: Kubernetes DynamicKubeletConfig must not be enabled

#### Severity: Medium

#### Status: Not Applicable

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> Kubernetes allows a user to configure kubelets with dynamic configurations.
> When dynamic configuration is used, the kubelet will watch for changes to the
> configuration file. When changes are made, the kubelet will automatically
> restart. Allowing this capability bypasses access restrictions and
> authorizations. Using this capability, an attacker can lower the security
> posture of the kubelet, which includes allowing the ability to run arbitrary
> commands in any container running on that node.

### [V-242400]: The Kubernetes API server must have Alpha APIs disabled

#### Severity: Medium

#### Status: Automated

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> Kubernetes allows alpha API calls within the API server. The alpha features
> are disabled by default since they are not ready for production and likely to
> change without notice. These features may also contain security issues that
> are rectified as the feature matures. To keep the Kubernetes cluster secure
> and stable, these alpha features must not be used.





#### Comments:

> The k8s-snap does not set the `--feature-gate` flag on the `kube-apiserver`.
>


#### Remediation

Edit `/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kube-apiserver` in order to set the argument
`--feature-gate` for service `kube-apiserver` as appropriate.

It is possible to leave this argument unset completely.

If you'd like to explicitly set it, ensure it is set to one of:
`.*AllAlpha=false.*`, `.*AllAlpha=0.*`

Afterwards restart the `kube-apiserver` service with:



    sudo systemctl restart snap.k8s.kube-apiserver



#### Auditing (as root)

Ensure that the argument `--feature-gate` for service `kube-apiserver` is set
as appropriate in the service's argument file
`/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kube-apiserver`.

Note: this Finding allows for this argument to be UNSET as well.

```bash
grep -E -q  '\-\-feature-gate=(.*AllAlpha=false.*|.*AllAlpha=0.*)' '/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kube-apiserver' || echo UNSET
test $? -eq 0 && echo PASS || echo FAIL
```

In the default configuration of the `k8s-snap`, resulting output lines will
start with `UNSET`.

The final line of the output will be `PASS`.



### [V-242402]: The Kubernetes API Server must have an audit log path set

#### Severity: Medium

#### Status: Automated

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> When Kubernetes is started, components and user services are started for
> auditing startup events, and events for components and services, it is
> important that auditing begin on startup. Within Kubernetes, audit data for
> all components is generated by the API server. To enable auditing to begin,
> an audit policy must be defined for the events and the information to be
> stored with each event. It is also necessary to give a secure location where
> the audit logs are to be stored. If an audit log path is not specified, all
> audit data is sent to studio.


#### Comments:

> This Finding refers to the `--audit-log-path` argument of the Kubernetes API
> Service.
>
> The k8s-snap does not configure auditing by default.
>
> Please review the [post-deployment hardening] guide for a full description on
> how to enable auditing for the kube-apiserver.
>
> This Finding is basically a duplicate of V-242465.
>


#### Remediation

Edit `/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kube-apiserver` in order to set the argument
`--audit-log-path` for service `kube-apiserver` as appropriate.

Ensure it is set to any explicit value.

Afterwards restart the `kube-apiserver` service with:



    sudo systemctl restart snap.k8s.kube-apiserver



#### Auditing (as root)

Ensure that the argument `--audit-log-path` for service `kube-apiserver` is set
as appropriate in the service's argument file

```bash
grep -E -q  '\-\-audit-log-path=(.*)' '/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kube-apiserver'
test $? -eq 0 && echo PASS || echo FAIL
```

The final line of the output will be `PASS`.



### [V-242403]: Kubernetes API Server must generate audit records that identify what type of event has occurred, identify the source of the event, contain the event results, identify any users, and identify any containers associated with the event

#### Severity: Medium

#### Status: Automated

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> Within Kubernetes, audit data for all components is generated by the API
> server. This audit data is important when there are issues, to include
> security incidents that must be investigated. To make the audit data
> worthwhile for the investigation of events, it is necessary to have the
> appropriate and required data logged. To fully understand the event, it is
> important to identify any users associated with the event.
>
> The API server policy file allows for the following levels of auditing: None
>       - Do not log events that match the rule. Metadata - Log request
>       metadata (requesting user, timestamp, resource, verb, etc.) but not
>             request or response body. Request - Log event metadata and
>       request body but not response body. RequestResponse - Log event

```

The final line of the output will be `PASS`.



### [V-242404]: Kubernetes Kubelet must deny hostname override

#### Severity: Medium

#### Status: Automated

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> Kubernetes allows for the overriding of hostnames. Allowing this feature to
> be implemented within the kubelets may break the TLS setup between the
> kubelet service and the API server. This setting also can make it difficult
> to associate logs with nodes if security analytics needs to take place. The
> better practice is to setup nodes with resolvable FQDNs and avoid overriding
> the hostnames.





#### Comments:

> The command line arguments of Kubelet in the k8s-snap are defined in the
> following file:
>
>     /var/snap/k8s/common/args/kubelet
>


#### Remediation

Edit `/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kubelet` in order to set the argument
`--hostname-override` for service `kubelet` as appropriate.

Ensure it is NOT set to any value.

Afterwards restart the `kubelet` service with:



    sudo systemctl restart snap.k8s.kubelet



#### Auditing (as root)

Ensure that the argument `--hostname-override` for service `kubelet` is set as
appropriate in the service's argument file `/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kubelet`.

Note: this Finding allows for this argument to be UNSET as well.

```bash
grep -E -qvz '\-\-hostname-override=(.*)' '/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kubelet' && echo UNSET
test $? -eq 0 && echo PASS || echo FAIL
```

The final line of the output will be `PASS`.



### [V-242405]: The Kubernetes manifests must be owned by root

#### Severity: Medium

#### Status: Automated

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> The manifest files contain the runtime configuration of the API server,
> proxy, scheduler, controller, and etcd. If an attacker can gain access to
> these files, changes can be made to open vulnerabilities and bypass user
> authorizations inherit within Kubernetes with RBAC implemented.





#### Comments:

### [V-242414]: The Kubernetes cluster must use non-privileged host ports for user pods

#### Severity: Medium

#### Status: Manual

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> Privileged ports are those ports below 1024 and that require system
> privileges for their use. If containers can use these ports, the container
> must be run as a privileged user. Kubernetes must stop containers that try to
> map to these ports directly. Allowing non-privileged ports to be mapped to
> the container-privileged port is the allowable method when a certain port is
> needed. An example is mapping port 8080 externally to port 80 in the
> container.





#### Comments:

> The Kubernetes System Administrators must manually inspect the Pods in all of
> the default namespaces to ensure there are no user-created Pods with
> Containers exposing privileged port numbers (< 1024).

### [V-242417]: Kubernetes must separate user functionality

#### Severity: Medium

#### Status: Manual

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> Separating user functionality from management functionality is a requirement
> for all the components within the Kubernetes Control Plane. Without the
> separation, users may have access to management functions that can degrade
> the Kubernetes architecture and the services being offered, and can offer a
> method to bypass testing and validation of functions before introduced into a
> production environment.





#### Comments:

> The Kubernetes System Administrators must manually inspect the Pods in all of
> the default namespaces to ensure there are no user-created Pods within them,
> and move them to dedicated user namespaces if present.

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> The Kubernetes API server communicates to the kubelet service on the nodes to
> deploy, update, and delete resources. If an attacker were able to get between
> this communication and modify the request, the Kubernetes cluster could be
> compromised. Using approved cypher suites for the communication ensures the
> protection of the transmitted information, confidentiality, and integrity so
> that the attacker cannot read or alter this communication.

`--enable-tls` for service `k8s-dqlite` as appropriate.

Ensure it is NOT set to one of: `false`, `0`

Afterwards restart the `k8s-dqlite` service with:



    sudo systemctl restart snap.k8s.k8s-dqlite



#### Auditing (as root)

Ensure that the argument `--enable-tls` for service `k8s-dqlite` is set as
appropriate in the service's argument file
`/var/snap/k8s/common/args/k8s-dqlite`.

Note: this Finding allows for this argument to be UNSET as well.

### [V-242438]: Kubernetes API Server must configure timeouts to limit attack surface

#### Severity: Medium

#### Status: Automated

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> Kubernetes API Server request timeouts sets the duration a request stays open
before timing out. Since the API Server is the central component in the
Kubernetes Control Plane, it is vital to protect this service. If request
timeouts were not set, malicious attacks or unwanted activities might affect
multiple deployments across different applications or environments. This might
deplete all resources from the Kubernetes infrastructure causing the
information system to go offline. The "--request-timeout" value must never be
set to "0". This disables the request-timeout feature. (By default, the
"--request-timeout" is set to "1 minute".)


#### Comments:

> The Finding also allows for setting a timeout larger than 300s.
>


#### Remediation

Edit `/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kube-apiserver` in order to set the argument
`--request-timeout` for service `kube-apiserver` as appropriate.

Ensure it is set to: `300s`

Afterwards restart the `kube-apiserver` service with:



    sudo systemctl restart snap.k8s.kube-apiserver



#### Auditing (as root)

Ensure that the argument `--request-timeout` for service `kube-apiserver` is
set as appropriate in the service's argument file
`/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kube-apiserver`.

```bash
grep -E -q  '\-\-request-timeout=(300s)' '/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kube-apiserver'
test $? -eq 0 && echo PASS || echo FAIL
```

The final line of the output will be `PASS`.



### [V-242442]: Kubernetes must remove old components after updated versions have been installed

#### Severity: Medium

#### Status: Not Applicable

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> Previous versions of Kubernetes components that are not removed after updates
have been installed may be exploited by adversaries by allowing the
vulnerabilities to still exist within the cluster. It is important for
Kubernetes to remove old pods when newer pods are created using new images to
always be at the desired security state.


#### Comments:

> This Finding recommends checking that no residual versions of Kubernetes
> components are left running following upgrades of the Kubernetes cluster.
>
> Thanks to the k8s-snap's distribution and upgrade model, it is not possible
> for this to occur, so this Finding is Not Applicable.
>



### [V-242443]: Kubernetes must contain the latest updates as authorized by IAVMs, CTOs, DTMs, and STIGs

#### Severity: Medium

#### Status: Not Applicable

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> Kubernetes software must stay up to date with the latest patches, service
packs, and hot fixes. Not updating the Kubernetes control plane will expose the
organization to vulnerabilities.
>
> Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident
response activities, or information system error handling must also be
addressed expeditiously.
>
> Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant container
platform components may vary based on a variety of factors including, for
example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of
the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered
flaw).
>
> This requirement will apply to software patch management solutions that are
used to install patches across the enclave and also to applications themselves
that are not part of that patch management solution. For example, many browsers
today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch
criticality, as well as system criticality will vary. Therefore, the tactical
situations regarding the patch management process will also vary. This means
that the time period utilized must be a configurable parameter. Time frames for
application of security-relevant software updates may be dependent upon the
IAVM process.
>
> The container platform components will be configured to check for and install
security-relevant software updates within an identified time period from the
availability of the update. The container platform registry will ensure the
images are current. The specific time period will be defined by an
authoritative source (e.g., IAVM, CTOs, DTMs, and STIGs).


#### Comments:

> This Finding recommends checking all Kubernetes component versions are
> actively supported.
>
> https://kubernetes.io/releases/version-skew-policy/#supported-versions
>
> Supported versions of the k8s-snap should always ship with supported versions
> of Kubernetes components within it, so this Finding is Not Applicable.

### [V-242444]: The Kubernetes component manifests must be owned by root

#### Severity: Medium

#### Status: Automated

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> The Kubernetes manifests are those files that contain the arguments and
settings for the Control Plane services. These services are etcd, the api
server, controller, proxy, and scheduler. If these files can be changed, the
scheduler will be implementing the changes immediately. Many of the security
settings within the document are implemented through these manifests.





#### Comments:

> The manifest files for the Kubernetes services in the k8s-snap are located in
> the following directories:

### [V-242452]: The Kubernetes kubelet KubeConfig must have file permissions set to 644 or more restrictive

#### Severity: Medium

#### Status: Automated

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> The Kubernetes kubelet agent registers nodes with the API Server, mounts
volume storage for pods, and performs health checks to containers within pods.
If these files can be modified, the information system would be unaware of pod
or container degradation. Many of the security settings within the document are
implemented through this file.


#### Step 1/2


#### Comments:

> Finding stipulates that permission mask should be at most 644, but they can
> also be set to be more restrictive.
>

supporting secure network communications in the Kubernetes Control Plane. If
these files can be modified, data traversing within the architecture components
would become insecure and compromised.

#### Comments:

> Finding stipulates that permission mask of all the '*.crt' files should be at
> most 644, but they can also be set to be more restrictive.
>
> Finding V-242467 stipulates the permissions of the '*.key' files.
>


#### Remediation

Ensure all of the following paths have correct permissions by running:

    chmod -R 644 /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-kubelet-client.crt /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt /etc/kubernetes/pki/front-proxy-ca.crt /etc/kubernetes/pki/kubelet.crt /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.crt /etc/kubernetes/pki/client-ca.crt /etc/kubernetes/pki/front-proxy-client.crt

#### Auditing (as root)

Ensure all required files have permissions '644' (or stricter):

```bash
stat -c %a '/etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-kubelet-client.crt' | grep -q 600 && echo PASS /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-kubelet-client.crt: 600 || echo FAIL /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-kubelet-client.crt: 600
stat -c %a '/etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt' | grep -q 600 && echo PASS /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt: 600 || echo FAIL /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt: 600
stat -c %a '/etc/kubernetes/pki/front-proxy-ca.crt' | grep -q 600 && echo PASS /etc/kubernetes/pki/front-proxy-ca.crt: 600 || echo FAIL /etc/kubernetes/pki/front-proxy-ca.crt: 600
stat -c %a '/etc/kubernetes/pki/kubelet.crt' | grep -q 600 && echo PASS /etc/kubernetes/pki/kubelet.crt: 600 || echo FAIL /etc/kubernetes/pki/kubelet.crt: 600
stat -c %a '/etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.crt' | grep -q 600 && echo PASS /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.crt: 600 || echo FAIL /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.crt: 600
stat -c %a '/etc/kubernetes/pki/client-ca.crt' | grep -q 600 && echo PASS /etc/kubernetes/pki/client-ca.crt: 600 || echo FAIL /etc/kubernetes/pki/client-ca.crt: 600
stat -c %a '/etc/kubernetes/pki/front-proxy-client.crt' | grep -q 600 && echo PASS /etc/kubernetes/pki/front-proxy-client.crt: 600 || echo FAIL /etc/kubernetes/pki/front-proxy-client.crt: 600
```

In the default configuration of the `k8s-snap`, resulting output lines will
start with `PASS`.


### [V-242467]: The Kubernetes PKI keys must have file permissions set to 600 or more restrictive

#### Severity: Medium

#### Status: Automated

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> The Kubernetes PKI directory contains all certificate key files supporting
secure network communications in the Kubernetes Control Plane. If these files
can be modified, data traversing within the architecture components would
become insecure and compromised.

#### Comments:

> Finding stipulates that permission mask of all the '*.key' files should be
> 600.
>
> Finding V-242467 stipulates the permissions of the '*.crt' files.
>


#### Remediation

Ensure all of the following paths have correct permissions by running:


    chmod -R 600 /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-kubelet-client.key /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key /etc/kubernetes/pki/front-proxy-client.key /etc/kubernetes/pki/serviceaccount.key /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.key /etc/kubernetes/pki/front-proxy-ca.key /etc/kubernetes/pki/kubelet.key

#### Auditing (as root)

Ensure all required files have permissions '600' (or stricter):

```bash
stat -c %a '/etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-kubelet-client.key' | grep -q 600 && echo PASS /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-kubelet-client.key: 600 || echo FAIL /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-kubelet-client.key: 600
stat -c %a '/etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key' | grep -q 600 && echo PASS /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key: 600 || echo FAIL /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key: 600
stat -c %a '/etc/kubernetes/pki/front-proxy-client.key' | grep -q 600 && echo PASS /etc/kubernetes/pki/front-proxy-client.key: 600 || echo FAIL /etc/kubernetes/pki/front-proxy-client.key: 600
stat -c %a '/etc/kubernetes/pki/serviceaccount.key' | grep -q 600 && echo PASS /etc/kubernetes/pki/serviceaccount.key: 600 || echo FAIL /etc/kubernetes/pki/serviceaccount.key: 600
stat -c %a '/etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.key' | grep -q 600 && echo PASS /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.key: 600 || echo FAIL /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.key: 600
stat -c %a '/etc/kubernetes/pki/front-proxy-ca.key' | grep -q 600 && echo PASS /etc/kubernetes/pki/front-proxy-ca.key: 600 || echo FAIL /etc/kubernetes/pki/front-proxy-ca.key: 600
stat -c %a '/etc/kubernetes/pki/kubelet.key' | grep -q 600 && echo PASS /etc/kubernetes/pki/kubelet.key: 600 || echo FAIL /etc/kubernetes/pki/kubelet.key: 600
```

In the default configuration of the `k8s-snap`, resulting output lines will
start with `PASS`.



### [V-245541]: Kubernetes Kubelet must not disable timeouts

#### Severity: Medium

#### Status: Automated

#### Upstream Finding Description:

> Idle connections from the Kubelet can be used by unauthorized users to
perform malicious activity to the nodes, pods, containers, and cluster within
the Kubernetes Control Plane. Setting the streamingConnectionIdleTimeout
defines the maximum time an idle session is permitted prior to disconnect.
Setting the value to "0" never disconnects any idle sessions. Idle timeouts
must never be set to "0" and should be defined at "5m" (the default is 4hr).


#### Comments:

> The k8s-snap does not pass a `--config` command line argument to the Kubelet
> service, nor does it explicitly pass `--streaming-connection-idle-timeout=5m`
> as a command line argument.
>
> The command line arguments of Kubelet in the k8s-snap are defined in the
> following file:
>
>     /var/snap/k8s/common/args/kubelet
>


#### Remediation

Edit `/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kubelet` in order to set the argument
`--streaming-connection-idle-timeout` for service `kubelet` as appropriate.

Ensure it is set to: `5m`

Afterwards restart the `kubelet` service with:

    sudo systemctl restart snap.k8s.kubelet


#### Auditing (as root)

Ensure that the argument `--streaming-connection-idle-timeout` for service
`kubelet` is set as appropriate in the service's argument file
`/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kubelet`.

```bash
grep -E -q  '\-\-streaming-connection-idle-timeout=(5m)' '/var/snap/k8s/common/args/kubelet'
test $? -eq 0 && echo PASS || echo FAIL
```

The final line of the output will be `PASS`.
