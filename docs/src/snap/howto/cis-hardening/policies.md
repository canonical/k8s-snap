kubectl delete clusterrolebinding [name]

Remediation:
```
Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the

```

#### Control 5.2.5

Description: `Minimize the admission of containers wishing to share the host network namespace (Automated)`

Remediation:
```

admission of `hostNetwork` containers.
```

#### Control 5.2.6

Description: `Minimize the admission of containers with allowPrivilegeEscalation (Automated)`

Remediation:

admission of containers with `.spec.allowPrivilegeEscalation` set to `true`.
```

#### Control 5.2.7

Description: `Minimize the admission of root containers (Automated)`

Remediation:
```
Create a policy for each namespace in the cluster, ensuring that either `MustRunAsNonRoot`
or `MustRunAs` with the range of UIDs not including 0, is set.

```

#### Control 5.2.13

Description: `Minimize the admission of containers which use HostPorts (Manual)`

#### Control 5.3.1

Description: `Ensure that the CNI in use supports NetworkPolicies (Manual)`

Remediation:
```
