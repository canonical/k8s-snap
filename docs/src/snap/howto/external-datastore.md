# How to use an external datastore

{{product}} supports using an external datastore such as etcd
instead of the bundled dqlite datastore.
This guide walks you through configuring an external etcd datastore.

## What you'll need

This guide assumes the following:

- You have root or sudo access to the machine
- You have an external etcd cluster
- You have installed the {{product}} snap
  (see How-to [Install {{product}} from a snap][snap-install-howto]).
- You have not bootstrapped the {{product}} cluster yet

```{warning}
The selection of the backing datastore can only be changed during the bootstrap process.
There is no migration path between the bundled dqlite and the external datastores.
```

## Adjust the bootstrap configuration

To use an external datastore, a configuration file that contains the required
datastore parameters needs to be provided to the bootstrap command.
Create a configuration file and insert the contents below while replacing
the placeholder values based on the configuration of your etcd cluster.

```yaml
datastore-type: external
datastore-url: "<etcd-member-addresses>"
datastore-ca-crt: |
  <etcd-root-ca-certificate>
datastore-client-crt: |
  <etcd-client-certificate>
datastore-client-key: |
  <etcd-client-key>
```
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
* `datastore-url` expects a comma separated list of addresses
  (e.g. `https://10.42.254.192:2379,https://10.42.254.193:2379,https://10.42.254.194:2379`)
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->
* `datastore-ca-crt` expects a certificate for the CA in PEM format
* `datastore-client-crt` expects a certificate that's signed by the root CA
  for the client in PEM format
* `datastore-client-key` expects a key for the client in PEM format

```{note}
`datastore-ca-crt`, `datastore-client-crt` and `datastore-client-key` options
can be omitted if the etcd cluster is not configured to use secure connections.
```

## Bootstrap the cluster

The next step is to bootstrap the cluster with our configuration file:

```
sudo k8s bootstrap --file /path/to/config.yaml
```

```{note}
The datastore can only be configured through the `--file` file option,
and is not available in interactive mode.
```

## Confirm the cluster is ready

It is recommended to ensure that the cluster initialises properly and is
running without issues. Run the command:

```
sudo k8s status --wait-ready
```

This command will wait until the cluster is ready and then display
the current status. The command will time-out if the cluster does not reach a
ready state.
