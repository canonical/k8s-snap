# Getting started

Installing {{product}} should only take a few minutes. This tutorial
explains how to install the snap package and some typical operations.

## What you will need

- An Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or 20.04 LTS environment to run the commands (or
  another operating system which supports snapd - see the
  [snapd documentation](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd))
- System Requirements: Your machine should have at least 40G disk space
  and 4G of memory

### 1. Install {{product}}

Install the {{product}} snap with:

```
sudo snap install k8s --edge --classic
```

### 2. Bootstrap a Kubernetes Cluster

Bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster with default configuration using:

```
sudo k8s bootstrap
```

This command initialises your cluster and configures your host system
as a Kubernetes node.
For custom configurations, you can explore additional options using:

```
sudo k8s bootstrap --help
```

### 3. Check cluster status

To confirm the installation was successful and your node is ready you
should run:

```
sudo k8s status
```

Run the following command to list all the pods in the `kube-system`
namespace:

```
sudo k8s kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

You will observe at least three pods running:

- **CoreDNS**: Provides DNS resolution services.
- **Network operator**: Manages the life-cycle of the networking solution.
- **Network agent**: Facilitates network management.

Confirm that {{product}} has transitioned to the `k8s is ready` state
by running:

```
sudo k8s status --wait-ready
```

### 5. Access Kubernetes

The standard tool for deploying and managing workloads on Kubernetes
is [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/).
For convenience, {{product}} bundles a version of
kubectl for you to use with no extra setup or configuration.
For example, to view your node you can run the command:

```
sudo k8s kubectl get nodes
```

â€¦or to see the running services:

```
sudo k8s kubectl get services
```

### 6. Deploy an app

Kubernetes is meant for deploying apps and services.
You can use the `kubectl`
command to do that as with any Kubernetes.

Let's deploy a demo NGINX server:

```
sudo k8s kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
```

This command launches a
[pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/), the smallest
deployable unit in Kubernetes, running the NGINX application within a
container.

You can check the status of your pods by running:

```
sudo k8s kubectl get pods
```

This command shows all pods in the default namespace.
It may take a moment for the pod to be ready and running.

### 7. Remove an app

To remove the NGINX workload, execute the following command:

```
sudo k8s kubectl delete deployment nginx

```

To verify that the pod has been removed, you can check the status of pods by
running:

```
sudo k8s kubectl get pods
```

### 8. Enable Local Storage

In scenarios where you need to preserve application data beyond the
life-cycle of the pod, Kubernetes provides persistent volumes.

With {{product}}, you can enable local-storage to configure
your storage solutions:

```
sudo k8s enable local-storage
```

To verify that the local-storage is enabled, execute:

```
sudo k8s status
```

You should see `local-storage enabled` in the command output.

Let's create a `PersistentVolumeClaim` and use it in a `Pod`.
For example, we can deploy the following manifest:

```
sudo k8s kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/canonical/k8s-snap/main/docs/src/assets/tutorial-pod-with-pvc.yaml
```

This command deploys a pod based on the YAML configuration of a
storage writer pod and a persistent volume claim with a capacity of 1G.

To confirm that the persistent volume is up and running:

```
sudo k8s kubectl get pvc myclaim
```

You can inspect the storage-writer-pod with:

```
sudo k8s kubectl describe pod storage-writer-pod
```

### 9. Disable Local Storage

Begin by removing the pod along with the persistent volume claim:

```
sudo k8s kubectl delete pvc myclaim
sudo k8s kubectl delete pod storage-writer-pod
```

Next, disable the local storage:

```
sudo k8s disable local-storage
```

### 10. Remove {{product}} (Optional)

To uninstall the {{product}} snap, execute:

```
sudo snap remove k8s
```

This command removes the `k8s` snap and automatically creates a snapshot of all
data for future restoration.

If you wish to remove the snap without saving a snapshot of its data, add
`--purge` to the command:

```
sudo snap remove k8s --purge
```

This option ensures complete removal of the snap and its associated data.
