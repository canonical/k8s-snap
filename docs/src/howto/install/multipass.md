# Install with Multipass (Ubuntu/Mac/Windows)

**Multipass** (https://multipass.run/) is a simple way to run Ubuntu in a
virtual machine, no matter what your undelying OS. It is the recommended way to
run Canonical Kubernetes on Windows and macOS systems, and is equally useful
for running multiple instances of the `k8s` snap on Ubuntu too.
