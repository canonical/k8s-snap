# How to use default DNS

Canonical Kubernetes includes a default DNS (Domain Name System) which is
essential for internal cluster communication. When enabled, the DNS facilitates
service discovery by assigning each service a DNS name. When disabled, you can
integrate a custom DNS solution into your cluster.


## What you'll need

This guide assumes the following:

- You have root or sudo access to the machine.
- You have a bootstraped Canonical Kubernetes cluster (see the [Getting
  Started][getting-started-guide] guide).

## Check DNS status

Find out whether DNS is enabled or disabled with the following command:

```bash
sudo k8s status
```

The default state for the cluster is `dns enabled`.

## Enable DNS

To enable DNS, run:

```bash
sudo k8s enable dns
```

For more information on this command, run:

```bash
sudo k8s help enable
```

## Configure DNS

Discover your configuration options by running:
```bash
sudo k8s set dns --help
```

You should see three options:
- `upstream-dns`: the dns server used to forward known entries
- `cluster-domain`: the cluster domain name
- `dns-ip`: the cluster IP to be assigned to the DNS service

Set a new DNS server IP for forwarding known entries:

```bash
sudo k8s set dns.upstream-dns=<new-ip>
```

Change the cluster domain name:

```bash
sudo k8s set dns.cluster-domain=<new-domain-name>
```

Assign a new cluster IP to the DNS service:

```bash
sudo k8s set dns.dns-ip=<new-cluster-ip>
```

Replace `<new-ip>`, `<new-domain-name>`, and `<new-cluster-ip>` with the
desired values for your DNS configuration.

## Disable DNS

Canonical Kubernetes also allows you to disable the built-in DNS, 
if you desire a custom solution:

``` {warning} Disabling DNS will disrupt internal cluster communication. Ensure a suitable
custom DNS solution is in place before disabling. You can re-enable DNS at any
point, and your cluster will return to normal functionality.```
```

```bash
sudo k8s disable dns
```

For more information on this command, execute:

```bash
sudo k8s help disable
```
