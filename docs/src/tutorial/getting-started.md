# Getting started

## What you will need
- An Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or 20.04 LTS environment to run the commands (or another operating system which supports snapd - see the [snapd documentation](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd?_ga=2.260591181.190515620.1707126165-607758451.1707126165))
- System Requirements: Your machine should have at least 20G disk space and 4G of memory

### 1. Install Canonical Kubernetes
Install the Canonical Kubernetes snap with:
```
sudo snap install k8s --classic
```

### 2. Bootstrap a Kubernetes Cluster
Bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster with default configuration using:
```
sudo k8s bootstrap
```
This command initializes your cluster and configures your host system as a Kubernetes node.
For custom confifurations, explore additional options using: `sudo k8s bootstrap --help`.

### 3. Check cluster status
To confirm the installation was successful and your node is ready you may run:
```
sudo k8s status --wait-ready
```
You should see `k8s is not ready` in the command output. This will change once we've enabled the network and dns component.

### 4. Enable Components
With Canonical Kubernetes, you can enable and disable core components such as DNS, gateway, ingress, network, and storage. For an overview of components, visit [Components Overview](#TODO)

DNS resolution is fundamental for communication between pods within the cluster and is essential for any Kubernetes deployment. To enable DNS resolution, run:
```
sudo k8s enable dns
```
To enable network connectivity execute:
```
sudo k8s enable network
```
Run the following command to list all the pods in the `kube-system` namespace:
```
sudo k8s kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```
You will observe three pods running:
- coredns: Provides DNS resolution services.
- network-operator: Manages the lifecycle of the Cilium networking solution.
- networking agent: Facilitates network management.

Confirm that Canonical Kubernetes has transitioned to the `k8s is ready` state by running:
```
sudo k8s status
```

### 5. Access Kubernetes
Canonical K8s bundles its own version of `kubectl` for accessing Kubernetes. Use it to run commands to monitor and control your Kubernetes. For example, to view your node:
```
sudo k8s kubectl get nodes
```
â€¦or to see the running services:
```
sudo k8s kubectl get services
```

### 6. Deploy an app
Kubernetes is meant for deploying apps and services. You can use the kubectl command to do that as with any Kubernetes. 

Let's deploy a demo nginx server:
```
sudo k8s kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
```
You can check the status of your pods by running:
```
sudo k8s kubectl get pods
```
This command shows all pods in the default namespace. It may take a moment for the pod to be ready and running.
