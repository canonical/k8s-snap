# Getting started

## What you will need
- An Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or 20.04 LTS environment to run the commands (or
  another operating system which supports snapd - see the
  [snapd documentation](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd))
- System Requirements: Your machine should have at least 20G disk space
  and 4G of memory

### 1. Install Canonical Kubernetes

Install the Canonical Kubernetes snap with:
```
sudo snap install k8s --classic
```

### 2. Bootstrap a Kubernetes Cluster

Bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster with default configuration using:

```
sudo k8s bootstrap
```

This command initialises your cluster and configures your host system 
as a Kubernetes node.
For custom configurations, you can explore additional options using: 

```
sudo k8s bootstrap --help
```

### 3. Check cluster status

To confirm the installation was successful and your node is ready you
should run:

```
sudo k8s status --wait-ready
```

You should see `k8s is not ready` in the command output. This will
change once we've enabled the `network` and `dns` components.

### 4. Enable Components

With Canonical Kubernetes, you can enable and disable core components
such as DNS, gateway, ingress, network, and storage. For an overview
of components, see the [Components Overview](#TODO)

DNS resolution is fundamental for communication between pods within
the cluster and is essential for any Kubernetes deployment. To enable
DNS resolution, run:

```
sudo k8s enable dns
```

To enable network connectivity execute:

```
sudo k8s enable network
```

Run the following command to list all the pods in the `kube-system`
namespace:

```
sudo k8s kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

You will observe three pods running:
- **coredns**: Provides DNS resolution services.
- **network-operator**: Manages the lifecycle of the networking solution.
- **networking agent**: Facilitates network management.

Confirm that Canonical Kubernetes has transitioned to the `k8s is ready` state by running:

```
sudo k8s status
```

Note: To disable a component execute `sudo k8s disable <component>`

### 5. Access Kubernetes
The standard tool for deploying and managing workloads on Kuberenetes is [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/). For convenience, Canonical Kubernetes bundles a version of kubectl for you to use with no extra setup or configuration. For example, to view your node you can run the command:

```
sudo k8s kubectl get nodes
```

â€¦or to see the running services:

```
sudo k8s kubectl get services
```

### 6. Deploy an app

Kubernetes is meant for deploying apps and services. You can use the `kubectl`
command to do that as with any Kubernetes. 

Let's deploy a demo NGINX server:

```
sudo k8s kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
```
This command launches a [pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/), the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, running the nginx application within a container.

You can check the status of your pods by running:

```
sudo k8s kubectl get pods
```

This command shows all pods in the default namespace. It may take a moment for
the pod to be ready and running.

### 7. Remove an app
To remove the NGINX workload, execute the following command:
```
sudo k8s kubectl delete deployment nginx --image=nginx

```

To verify that the pod has been removed, you can check the status of pods by running:

```
sudo k8s kubectl get pods
```
