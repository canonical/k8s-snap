# Guide to Basic Operations with Kubernetes using kubectl

## Introduction

This guide will walk you through performing basic operations on a Kubernetes
cluster using kubectl. Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to
automate deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A bootstrapped Canonical K8s cluster (See [insert link]...)

## Table of Contents

1. [The Kubectl Command](#check-kubernetes-version)
2. [Formatting Output](#formatting-output)
3. [Configuration](#viewing-default-configrau)

## The Kubectl Command

This commands interacts with the Kubernetes API server (kube-apiserver) and is the most commonly used command when working with Kubernetes, so let's take some time to familiarize ourselves with it.

It's syntax is as follows:

```
sudo k8s kubectl [command] [TYPE] [NAME] [flags]
```

- `command` is one of the commands defined [upstream](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/) like `get`, `delete` and `apply`.

- `TYPE` is the Kubernetes API resource type you want to interact with (Use `sudo k8s kubectl api-resources` to see all the available resources) like `node`, `pod`, `secret`. Remember you can use the singular, plural or abbreviated form of a type.
```
sudo k8s kubectl get deploy
sudo k8s kubectl get deployment
sudo k8s kubectl get deployments
```

- `NAME` is the name of the instance of a resource you want to interact with, like the name of a pod. If it's omitted kube-apiserver will return all instances of that resource type.

- `flags` is for optional flags and will change depending on which command you want to use `sudo k8s kubectl [command] -h` will show you available flags.

## Formatting Output

Kubectl offers powerful ways to consume it's output. Let's use the `-o` option to find the IP of the `storage-writer-pod` we created.

```
sudo k8s kubectl get pod storage-writer-pod -o yaml | yq '.status.podIP'
```

This is very useful if you want to create scripts that interact with a cluster and need to know it's status.

## Configuration

Let's see the configuration that Canonical K8s provides for your cluster out of the box.

```
sudo k8s kubectl config view
```

```
‚ùØ sudo k8s kubectl config view
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: DATA+OMITTED
    server: https://127.0.0.1:6443
  name: k8s
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: k8s
    user: k8s-user
  name: k8s
current-context: k8s
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: k8s-user
  user:
    token: REDACTED
```

We can deduce a few things from this information.

The control plane of the Kubernetes cluster lives on port 6443. This is the address that the `kubectl` command makes it's API requests to.

We can also see that a default context called `k8s` and a default user called `k8s-user` were created.

Note:

In Canonical K8s, the `kubeconfig` file that is being read to display the configuration when you run `kubectl config view` lives at `/snap/k8s/current/k8s/config/kubeconfig`. You can change this by setting a `KUBECONFIG` environment variable or passing the `--kubeconfig` flag to a command.
