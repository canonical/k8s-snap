issues.

## Invalid Kubeconfig

### Problem

The Kubernetes config file generated by the `k8s` CLI can not be used to access
the cluster from an external machine.

### Explanation

A common technique for viewing a cluster Kubeconfig is by using the
`kubectl config view` command.

The `k8s kubectl` command invokes an integrated `kubectl` client. Thus
`k8s kubectl config view` will output a seemingly valid Kubeconfig file.
However, this will only be valid on cluster nodes where control plane services
are available on localhost endpoints.

### Solution

Use `k8s config` instead of `k8s kubectl config` to generate a Kubeconfig file
that is valid for use on external machines.
