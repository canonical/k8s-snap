# Roadmap

The Canonical Kubernetes team enthusiastically supports the idea of a public
roadmap, letting everyone know the headline features we are working on and the
future direction and priorities of the project.

Our roadmap matches the cadence of the Ubuntu release cycle, so `24.10` is the
same as the release date for Ubuntu 24.10.
