# Roadmap

The Canonical Kubernetes team recognises the value of having a public roadmap,
letting everyone know the headline features we are working on and the future
direction and priorities of the project.

Our roadmap matches the cadence of the Ubuntu release cycle, so `24.10` is the
same as the release date for Ubuntu 24.10.
