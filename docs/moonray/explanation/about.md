# What is {{product}}?

At its core, {{product}} is a full implementation of upstream
[Kubernetes][] delivered in a compact, secure, reliable [snap][] package. As the
upstream Kubernetes services are not all that is required for a fully
functional cluster, additional services and features are built in. You can
deploy the snap and have a single-node cluster up and running in minutes.
