# Configuration for the Sphinx documentation builder.
# All configuration specific to your project should be done in this file.
#
# For the full list of built-in configuration values, see the documentation:
# https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html
# For our custom configuration, see the Canonical Sphinx extension:

#
# If you're not familiar with Sphinx and don't want to use advanced
# features, it is sufficient to update the settings in the "Project

### Project information
############################################################

# Product name
project = 'Moonray'
author = 'Canonical Ltd.'

# The title you want to display for the documentation in the sidebar.
# You might want to include a version number here.
# To not display any title, set this option to an empty string.
html_title = project + ' documentation'

# The default value uses CC-BY-SA as the license and the current year
# as the copyright year.
#
# If your documentation needs a different copyright license, use that
# instead of 'CC-BY-SA'. Also, if your documentation is included as
# part of the code repository of your project, it'll inherit the license
# of the code. So you'll need to specify that license here (instead of
# 'CC-BY-SA').
#
# For static works, it is common to provide the year of first publication.
# Another option is to give the first year and the current year
# for documentation that is often changed, e.g. 2022â€“2023 (note the en-dash).
#
# A way to check a GitHub repo's creation date is to obtain a classic GitHub
# token with 'repo' permissions here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# Next, use 'curl' and 'jq' to extract the date from the GitHub API's output:
#
# curl -H 'Authorization: token <TOKEN>' \
#   -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.raw' \
#   https://api.github.com/repos/canonical/<REPO> | jq '.created_at'

### Additions to default configuration

# substitution, deflist, linkify
# If you need more extensions, add them here.
# myst_enable_extensions = set()

# You must include the canonical_sphinx extension here.
# This extension automatically enables the following Sphinx extensions:
# custom-rst-roles, myst_parser, notfound.extension, related-links,
# sphinx_copybutton, sphinx_design, sphinx_tabs.tabs,
# sphinx_reredirects, sphinxcontrib.jquery, sphinxext.opengraph,
# terminal-output, youtube-links
# If you need more extensions, add them here (in addition to
# canonical_sphinx).

# Add custom JavaScript files (located in .sphinx/_static/)

## The following settings override the default configuration.

# Specify a reST string that is included at the end of each file.
# The suggested value pulls the reuse/links.txt file into each reST file.

# By default, the documentation includes a feedback button at the top.
# You can disable it by setting the following configuration to True.

# that you want to link to:
