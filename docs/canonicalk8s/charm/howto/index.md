# How-to guides

If you have a specific goal, and are already familiar with Kubernetes, our
How-to guides are more specific and contain less background information.
Theyâ€™ll help you achieve an end result but may require you to understand and
adapt the steps to fit your specific requirements.

## Install and configure

Installation follows a similar pattern on all platforms, but some
differences must be addressed in each case. You may also want to customize the
installation of your Canonical Kubernetes nodes.
