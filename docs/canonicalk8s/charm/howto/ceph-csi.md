# How to integrate {{product}} with ceph-csi

[Ceph] can be used to hold Kubernetes persistent volumes and is the recommended
storage solution for {{product}}.

The ``ceph-csi`` provisioner attaches the Ceph volumes to Kubernetes workloads.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes an existing {{product}} cluster.
See the [charm installation] guide for more details.

In case of localhost/LXD Juju clouds, please make sure that the K8s units are
configured to use VM containers with Ubuntu 22.04 as the base and adding the
``virt-type=virtual-machine`` constraint. In order for K8s to function properly,
an adequate amount of resources must be allocated:

```{literalinclude} ../../_parts/install.md
:start-after: <!-- juju vm start -->
:end-before: <!-- juju vm end -->
```

## Deploying Ceph

Deploy a Ceph cluster containing one monitor and one storage unit
(OSDs). In this example, a limited amount of resources is being allocated.

```
juju deploy -n 1 ceph-mon \
    --constraints "cores=2 mem=4G root-disk=16G" \
    --config monitor-count=1 \
    --config expected-osd-count=1
juju deploy -n 1 ceph-osd \
    --constraints "cores=2 mem=4G root-disk=16G" \
    --storage osd-devices=1G,1 --storage osd-journals=1G,1
juju integrate ceph-osd:mon ceph-mon:osd
```

If using LXD, configure the OSD unit to use VM containers by adding the
constraint: ``virt-type=virtual-machine``.

Once the units are ready, deploy ``ceph-csi``. By default, this enables
the ``ceph-xfs`` and ``ceph-ext4`` storage classes, which leverage
Ceph RBD.

```
juju deploy ceph-csi --config provisioner-replicas=1
juju integrate ceph-csi k8s:ceph-k8s-info
juju integrate ceph-csi ceph-mon:client
```

CephFS support can optionally be enabled:

```
juju deploy ceph-fs
juju integrate ceph-fs:ceph-mds ceph-mon:mds
juju config ceph-csi cephfs-enable=True
```

## Validating the CSI integration

Ensure that the storage classes are available and that the
CSI pods are running:

```
juju ssh k8s/leader -- sudo k8s kubectl get sc,po --namespace default
```

The list should include the ``ceph-xfs`` and ``ceph-ext4`` storage classes as
well as ``cephfs``, if it was enabled.

Verify that Ceph PVCs work as expected. Connect to the k8s leader unit
and define a PVC like so:

```
juju ssh k8s/leader

cat <<EOF > /tmp/pvc.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: raw-block-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 64Mi
  storageClassName: ceph-xfs
EOF

sudo k8s kubectl apply -f /tmp/pvc.yaml
```

Next, create a pod that writes to a Ceph volume:

```
cat <<EOF > /tmp/writer.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pv-writer-test
  namespace: default
spec:
  restartPolicy: Never
  volumes:
  - name: pvc-test
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: raw-block-pvc
  containers:
  - name: pv-writer
    image: busybox
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo 'PVC test data.' > /pvc/test_file"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: pvc-test
      mountPath: /pvc
EOF

sudo k8s kubectl apply -f /tmp/writer.yaml
```

If the pod completes successfully, our Ceph CSI integration is functional.

```
sudo k8s kubectl wait pod/pv-writer-test \
    --for=jsonpath='{.status.phase}'="Succeeded" \
    --timeout 2m
```

## Relate to multiple Ceph clusters

So far, this guide demonstrates to how to integrate with a single Ceph cluster
represented by the single `ceph-mon` application. However {{product}} supports
multiple Ceph clusters. The same `ceph-mon`, `ceph-osd`, and `ceph-csi` charms
can be deployed again as separate Juju applications with different names.

Deploy an alternate Ceph cluster containing one monitor and one storage unit
(OSDs) -- again limiting the resources allocated.

```
juju deploy -n 1 ceph-mon-alt ceph-mon \
    --constraints "cores=2 mem=4G root-disk=16G" \
    --config monitor-count=1 \
    --config expected-osd-count=1
juju deploy -n 1 ceph-osd-alt ceph-osd \
    --constraints "cores=2 mem=4G root-disk=16G" \
    --storage osd-devices=1G,1 --storage osd-journals=1G,1
juju deploy ceph-csi-alt ceph-csi \
    --config provisioner-replicas=1
juju integrate ceph-csi-alt k8s:ceph-k8s-info
juju integrate ceph-csi-alt ceph-mon-alt:client
juju integrate ceph-osd-alt:mon ceph-mon-alt:osd
```

These applications still uses the same charms, but represent new application
instances.  A new ceph-cluster via `ceph-mon-alt` and `ceph-osd-alt` and a new
integration with Kubernetes by `ceph-csi-alt`.

There are some Kubernetes Resources which collide in this deployment style.
The admin will notice the `ceph-csi-alt` application in the blocked state with
a status detailing the resource conflicts it detects:

example)
`10 Kubernetes resource collisions (action: list-resources)`

List the collisions by running an action on the charm:

```
juju run ceph-csi-alt/leader list-resources
```

### Resolving collisions

#### Namespace collisions

Many of the Kubernetes Resources managed by the `ceph-csi` charm have an 
associated namespace. Ensure the configuration for the `ceph-csi-alt`
application changes so that it doesn't collide with `ceph-csi`.

```
juju exec k8s/leader -- k8s kubectl create namespace ceph-csi-alt
juju config ceph-csi-alt namespace=ceph-csi-alt
```

After this, the number of collisions between the two applications drop off,
but there could still be collisions to investigate.

#### Storage Class collisions

StorageClass Kubernetes Resources managed by the `ceph-csi` charm are
cluster-wide resources and have no namespace.

For each of the supported StorageClass types, there is an independent formatter.

* `ext4`, see [ceph-ext4-storage-class-name-formatter]
* `xfs`, see [ceph-xfs-storage-class-name-formatter]
* `cephfs`, see [cephfs-storage-class-name-formatter]

Each formatter has similar, but distinct formatting rules, so take care to plan
the storage-class names accordingly.

example)

```
juju config ceph-csi-alt cephfs-storage-class-name-formatter="cephfs-{name}-{app}"
```

#### RBAC collisions

RBAC Kubernetes Resources managed by the `ceph-csi` charm are cluster-wide
resources and have no namespace. Two such resources are `ClusterRole` and
`ClusterRoleBinding`.

The charm can be configured to craft separate names for these resources.  The
Juju admin can format the names of these objects using a custom formatter.

See [ceph-rbac-name-formatter] docs for more details.

```
juju config ceph-csi-alt ceph-rbac-name-formatter="{name}-{app}"
```
