## Other documentation types

Alternatively, the [Tutorials section] contains step-by-step tutorials to help
guide you through exploring and using {{product}}.

If you have a specific goal our [How-to guides] have more in-depth detail than
tutorials and can be applied to a broader set of applications. Theyâ€™ll help you
achieve an end-result but may require you to understand and adapt the steps to
fit your specific requirements.

Finally, for a better understanding of how {{product}} works and
related topics such as security, our [Explanation section] helps you to expand
your knowledge and get the most out of Kubernetes.
