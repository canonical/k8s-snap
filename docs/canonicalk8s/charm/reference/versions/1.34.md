# 1.34

**{{product}} Charms 1.34 - Release notes - X November 2025**

Welcome to the 1.34 release of {{product}} charms, the Juju operators
for {{product}}! These release notes cover the highlights of this release.

## What’s new

- **Kubernetes 1.34** - read more about the upstream release
[here][upstream release].
- **{{product}} Snap 1.34** - read more about the snap release
[here][snap release page].
- **Observability for managed etcd** - enable observability and monitoring of the managed etcd service with COS
#  **Grafana dashboard improvements** - update the labels and scripts used to scrape metrics from the cluster to include etcd observability


## Bug fixes

- Improve the clean up and removal of unused tokens ([#700](https://github.com/canonical/k8s-operator/pull/700))
- Make COS k8s nodes more resilient to node failure by 
#cos workers get their info, the leader changes, they are not updated so can't send data anymore 
#make the cos-worker-tokens and cos-tokens available to the workers once the leader has changed so they can still scrape metrics
#fix the logic in the k8s cluster to ensure a change to the leader nodes does not affect COS relations 
#the loss of a leader node no longer results in the loss of metrics from COS workers
- Allow the sharing of cos-tokens for grafana-agent metrics scraping so node losses can be handled gracefully ([#649](https://github.com/canonical/k8s-operator/pull/649))
