```
k8s refresh-certs [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --certificates strings           List of certificates to renew in the cluster (must be used with --expires-in). Defaults to all certificates.
                                       Allowed values:
                                       Worker nodes: kubelet, kubelet.conf, proxy.conf
                                       Control Plane nodes: admin.conf, apiserver, apiserver-kubelet-client, controller.conf, front-proxy-client, kubelet, kubelet.conf, proxy.conf, scheduler.conf
      --expires-in string              the time until the certificates expire, e.g., 1h, 2d, 4mo, 5y. Aditionally, any valid time unit for ParseDuration is accepted.
      --external-certificates string   path to a YAML file containing external certificate data in PEM format. If the cluster was bootstrapped with external certificates, the certificates will be updated. Use '-' to read from stdin.
      --extra-sans stringArray         extra SANs to add to the certificates.
  -h, --help                           help for refresh-certs
