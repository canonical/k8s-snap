# {{product}} documentation

{{product}} is a performant, lightweight, secure and
opinionated distribution of **Kubernetes** which includes everything needed to
create and manage a scalable cluster suitable for all use cases.

{{product}} builds upon upstream Kubernetes by providing all the extra services
such as a container runtime, a CNI, DNS services, an ingress gateway and more
that are necessary to have a fully functioning cluster all in one convenient
location - a snap!

Staying up-to-date with upstream Kubernetes security
patches and updates with {{product}} is a seamless experience, freeing up time
for application
development and innovation without having to worry about the infrastructure.

Whether you are deploying a small cluster to get accustomed to Kubernetes or a
huge enterprise level deployment across the globe, {{product}} can cater to
your needs. If you would like to jump straight in, head to the
[snap getting started tutorial!](/snap/tutorial/getting-started.md)
