If you have a specific goal our [How-to guides] have more in-depth detail than
tutorials and can be applied to a broader set of applications. Theyâ€™ll help you
achieve an end-result but may require you to understand and adapt the steps to
fit your specific requirements.

For a better understanding of how {{product}} works and related topics
such as security, our [Explanation section] helps you to expand your knowledge
and get the most out of Kubernetes.

Finally, our [Reference section] is for when you need to check specific details
or information such as the command reference or release notes.
