# 1.32

**{{product}} 1.32 - Release notes - 12 December 2024**

Welcome to the first [LTS release] of {{product}}!
These release notes cover the highlights of this release.

## Requirements and compatibility

{{product}} can be installed on a variety of operating systems using several
methods. For specific requirements, see the [Installation guides].

## What’s new

- **Kubernetes 1.32** - read more about the upstream release [here].

- **User provided certificate validation** - Now {{product}} can validate user
provided certificates allowing greater control over the cluster.

- **Additional CNIs** - By adding the annotation `cni.exclusive`, users can now
 configure their {{product}} cluster to add additional CNIs such as Multus
 providing greater networking possibilities.

- **Configurable containerd installation** - This new feature allows the user to
specify the installation path of containerd at bootstrap and node join with
`containerd-base-dir`. This means configurations files will not conflict with
 other containerd installations already on the host (for example from docker).
