# 1.33

**{{product}} 1.33 - Release notes - 30 June 2025**

## Requirements and compatibility

{{product}} can be installed on a variety of operating systems using several
methods. For specific requirements, see the [Installation guides].

## Whatâ€™s new

- **Kubernetes 1.33** - read more about the upstream release [here].

- **Controlled feature upgrade process** - With the second release of 
{{product}}, seamlessly upgrade from one version to the next. With a 
coordinated approach to our feature upgrades and snap refreshes, version 
drift is prevented and this ensures a smooth, predictable upgrade path for 
cluster features.

- **Support updating node certificates** - Users
can now update their external certificates on a 
running node. See our [external certificate refresh guide] for more 
information.

- **`k8s certs-status` command** - This new command provides a detailed view of 
the certificates status on a node.

- **`k8s inspect` command** - This new command collects diagnostics and other 
relevant information from a Kubernetes node, either control-plane or worker 
node, and compiles them into a tarball report.To find out more about what 
information is collected in the tarball see our 
[inspection reports reference guide].
