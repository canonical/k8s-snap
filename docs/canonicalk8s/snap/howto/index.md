# How-to guides

If you have a specific goal, but are already familiar with Kubernetes, our
How-to guides are more specific and contain less background information.
Theyâ€™ll help you achieve an end result but may require you to understand and
adapt the steps to fit your specific requirements.

Overview <self>
```

## Installation

Installation follows a very similar pattern on all platforms, but some minor
differences must be addressed in each case. You may also want to customize the
installation of your {{product}} nodes.

```{toctree}
:titlesonly:
Install <install/index>
```

## Networking

{{product}} comes with default networking features for a fully functioning
cluster. More advanced features can be enabled by a few configuration steps.

```{toctree}
:titlesonly:
networking/index
```

## Storage

Specific storage needs of your cluster can be met by setting up persistent
storage or replacing the default datastore with an external one such as `etcd`.

```{toctree}
:titlesonly:
storage/index
Use an external datastore <external-datastore>
```

## Security

Harden your cluster according to industry standards.

```{toctree}
:titlesonly:
security/index
```

## Cluster upgrades and refreshes

```{toctree}
:titlesonly:
Manage upgrades <upgrades>
Refresh Kubernetes Certificates <refresh-certs>
Use intermediate CAs with Vault <intermediate-ca.md>
```

## Manage images

Manage cluster images directly through containerd.

```{toctree}
:titlesonly:
Manage images <image-management.md>
```

## Cluster back up and restore

```{toctree}
:titlesonly:
Back up and restore <backup-restore>
```

## Monitoring and troubleshooting

Sometimes things go wrong and you need to troubleshoot. Having observability
set up on your cluster can greatly increase the rate at which a problem is
identified and solved.

```{toctree}
:titlesonly:
Set up cluster observability  <observability>
Recover a cluster after quorum loss <restore-quorum>
Troubleshooting <troubleshooting>
Get support <support>
```

## Enhanced Platform Awareness

EPA utilizes server hardware capabilities in the {{product}} cluster. It
exposes technologies such as HugePages, CPU pinning, SR-IOV and more.

```{toctree}
:titlesonly:
Set up Enhanced Platform Awareness <epa>
```

## Contribute

Contribute to the {{product}} project! Add to the code, documentation or both!
