# Install {{product}} in development environments

We recommend testing {{product}} in an isolated environment such as a clean
virtual machine or LXD container.

If you choose to install {{product}} directly on your development machine,
please take note of the following considerations.

## Containerd conflicts

{{product}} uses the default containerd paths, which means that a {{product}}
installation will conflict with any existing system configuration where
containerd is already installed. For example, if you have Docker installed,
or another Kubernetes distribution that uses containerd.

You may specify a custom containerd path like so:

```bash
cat <<EOF | sudo k8s bootstrap --file -
containerd-base-dir: $containerdBaseDir
cluster-config:
  network:
    enabled: true
  dns:
    enabled: true
  local-storage:
    enabled: true
EOF
```

## Changing IP addresses

The local IP addresses of your development machine are likely to change,
for example after joining a different wi-fi network.

In this case, you may configure {{product}} to use the ``localhost`` address:

```bash
sudo k8s bootstrap --address=127.0.0.1
```

## Conflicting Docker iptables rules

Docker can interfere with LXD and Multipass installations, setting the global
``FORWARD`` policy to drop.

See the [lxd network troubleshooting guide] for more details and possible
workarounds.
