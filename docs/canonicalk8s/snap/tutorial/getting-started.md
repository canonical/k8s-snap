# Getting started

Installing {{product}} should only take a few minutes. This tutorial
explains how to install the snap package and some typical operations.

## Prerequisites

- System Requirements: Your machine should have at least **40G disk space**
  and **4G of memory**
- An **Ubuntu** environment to run the commands (or
  another operating system which supports snapd - see the
  [snapd documentation](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd))
- A system with **no previous installations of containerd/docker** as this may
cause conflicts. Consider using a [LXD virtual machine] if you would like an
isolated working environment.

### 1. Install {{product}}

Install the {{product}} snap with:

```{literalinclude} ../../_parts/install.md
:start-after: <!-- snap start -->
:end-before: <!-- snap end -->
```

### 2. Bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster

The bootstrap command initializes your cluster and configures your host system
as a Kubernetes node. Bootstrapping the cluster can only be done once.

If you would like to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster with
default configuration run:

```
sudo k8s bootstrap
```

For custom configurations, you can explore additional options using:

```
sudo k8s bootstrap --help
```

### 3. Check cluster status

It may take a few minutes for the cluster to be ready. To confirm the
installation was successful, use `k8s status` with the `wait-ready` flag
to wait for {{product}} to bring up the cluster:


```
sudo k8s status --wait-ready
```

```{important}
This command waits a few minutes before timing out.
On a very slow network connection, or a system with very limited resources,
this default timeout might be insufficient resulting in a "Context cancelled"
error. In that case, you can either increase the timeout using the  `--timeout`
flag or re-run the command to continue waiting until the cluster is ready.
```

### 5. Access Kubernetes

The standard tool for deploying and managing workloads on Kubernetes
is [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/).
For convenience, {{product}} bundles a version of
kubectl for you to use with no extra setup or configuration.
For example, to view your node you can run the command:

```
sudo k8s kubectl get nodes
```

â€¦or to see the running services:

```
sudo k8s kubectl get services
```

Run the following command to list all the pods in the `kube-system`
namespace:

```
sudo k8s kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

You will observe at least four pods running. The status of the pods may be in
`ContainerCreating` while they are being initialized. They should turn to
`Running` after a few seconds.

The functions of these pods are:

- **CoreDNS (coredns)**: Provides DNS resolution services.
- **Network operator (cilium-operator)**: Manages the life-cycle of the
networking solution.
- **Network agent (cilium)**: Facilitates network management.
- **Storage controller (ck-storage-rawfile-csi-controller)**: Manages the
life-cycle of the local storage solution.
- **Storage agent (ck-storage-rawfile-csi-node)** : Facilitates local storage
management.


### 6. Deploy an app

Kubernetes is meant for deploying apps and services.
You can use the `kubectl`
command to do that as with any Kubernetes.

Let's deploy a demo NGINX server:

```
sudo k8s kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
```

This command launches a
[pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/), the smallest
deployable unit in Kubernetes, running the NGINX application within a
container.

You can check the status of your pods by running:

```
sudo k8s kubectl get pods
```

This command shows all pods in the default namespace.
It may take a moment for the pod to be ready and running.

### 7. Remove an app

To remove the NGINX workload, execute the following command:

```
sudo k8s kubectl delete deployment nginx
```

To verify that the pod has been removed, you can check the status of pods by
running:

```
sudo k8s kubectl get pods
```

### 8. Enable local storage

In scenarios where you need to preserve application data beyond the
life-cycle of the pod, Kubernetes provides persistent volumes.

With {{product}}, you can enable local-storage to configure
your storage solutions:

```
sudo k8s enable local-storage
```

To verify that the local-storage is enabled, execute:

```
sudo k8s status
```

You should see `local-storage enabled` in the command output.

Let's create a `PersistentVolumeClaim` and use it in a `Pod`.
For example, we can deploy the following manifest:

```
sudo k8s kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/canonical/k8s-snap/main/docs/canonicalk8s/assets/tutorial-pod-with-pvc.yaml
```

This command deploys a pod based on the YAML configuration of a
storage writer pod and a persistent volume claim called `myclaim` with a
capacity of 1G.

To confirm that the persistent volume is up and running:

```
sudo k8s kubectl get pvc myclaim
```

You can inspect the storage-writer-pod with:

```
sudo k8s kubectl describe pod storage-writer-pod
```

### 9. Disable local storage

Begin by removing the pod along with the persistent volume claim:

```
sudo k8s kubectl delete pod storage-writer-pod
sudo k8s kubectl delete pvc myclaim
```

Next, disable the local storage:

```
sudo k8s disable local-storage
```

### 10. Remove {{product}} (Optional)

If you wish to remove the snap without saving a snapshot of its data execute:

```
sudo snap remove k8s --purge
```

The `--purge` flag ensures complete removal of the snap and its associated data.
If you would like to maintain a snapshot of the `k8s` snap for future
restoration, simply run :

```
sudo snap remove k8s
```

The snapshot is a copy of the user, system and configuration data stored by
snapd for the `k8s` snap. This data can be found in `/var/snap/k8s`.
