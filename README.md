**Canonical Kubernetes** is the fastest, easiest way to deploy a fully-conformant Kubernetes cluster. Harnessing pure upstream Kubernetes, this distribution adds the missing pieces (e.g. ingress, dns, networking) for a zero-ops experience.

For more information and instructions, please see the official documentation at: [https://documentation.ubuntu.com/canonical-kubernetes](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/canonical-kubernetes/)

## Quickstart

Install Canonical Kubernetes and initialise the cluster with:

```bash
sudo snap install k8s --channel=1.30-classic/beta --classic
sudo k8s bootstrap
```

Confirm the installation was successful:

```bash
sudo k8s status
```

Use `kubectl` to interact with k8s:

```bash
sudo k8s kubectl get pods -A
```

Remove the snap with:

```bash
sudo snap remove k8s --purge
```


## Build the project from source

To build the Kubernetes snap on an Ubuntu machine you need Snapcraft.

```bash
sudo snap install snapcraft --classic
```

Building the project by running `snapcraft` in the root of this repository. Snapcraft spawns a VM managed by Multipass and builds the snap inside it. If you donâ€™t have Multipass installed, snapcraft will first prompt for its automatic installation.

After snapcraft completes, you can install the newly compiled snap:

```bash
sudo snap install k8s_*.snap --classic --dangerous
```
