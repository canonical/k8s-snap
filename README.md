# Canonical Kubernetes Snap
[![End to End Tests](https://github.com/canonical/k8s-snap/actions/workflows/e2e.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/canonical/k8s-snap/actions/workflows/e2e.yaml)

**Canonical Kubernetes** is the fastest, easiest way to deploy a fully-conformant Kubernetes cluster. Harnessing pure upstream Kubernetes, this distribution adds the missing pieces (e.g. ingress, dns, networking) for a zero-ops experience. For single-node clusters it can be deployed with two commands. Add new nodes with just two more. 

Get started in just two commands:
```bash
sudo snap install k8s --classic
```

And bring up the cluster:
```bash
sudo k8s bootstrap
```

For more information and instructions, please see the official documentation at: https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes

### What is included in the k8s distribution

In addition to the upstream Kubernetes services, Canonical Kubernetes also includes:

- a DNS service for the node
- a CNI for the node/cluster
- a simple local storage provider
- an ingress provider
- a load-balancer
- a gateway API controller
- a metrics server


## Quickstart

Install the Canonical Kubernetes and initialise the cluster with:

```bash
sudo snap install k8s --edge --classic
sudo k8s bootstrap
```

Confirm the installation was successful:

```bash
sudo k8s status
```

Use `kubectl` to interact with k8s:

```bash
sudo k8s kubectl get pods -A
```

Remove the snap with:

```bash
sudo snap remove k8s --purge
```


## Build the project from source

To build the Kubernetes snap on an Ubuntu machine you need Snapcraft.

```
sudo snap install snapcraft --classic
```

Building the project by running `snapcraft` in the root of this repository. Snapcraft spawns a VM managed by Multipass and builds the snap inside it. If you donâ€™t have Multipass installed, snapcraft will first prompt for its automatic installation.

After snapcraft completes, you can install the newly compiled snap:

```
sudo snap install k8s_*.snap --classic --dangerous
```
