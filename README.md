**Canonical Kubernetes** is an opinionated distribution of Kubernetes which
includes all the tools needed to create and manage a scalable cluster with
[LTS](https://canonical.com/blog/12-year-lts-for-kubernetes). Canonical
Kubernetes builds on the main Kubernetes project by providing all
the necessary pieces for a zero-ops experience, such as Ingress, DNS,
networking, and so on. Whether you are a complete beginner to Kubernetes or a
seasoned system administrator, Canonical Kubernetes provides a way to easily
deploy a cluster allowing you to focus on applications over infrastructure.

## Basic usage

Canonical Kubernetes provides a way for you to easily enable, disable, and
configure the essential default Kubernetes features in your cluster.

For example, if you want a load balancer with L2 mode enabled, run:

```bash
sudo k8s enable load-balancer
sudo k8s set load-balancer.l2-mode=true
```

Or, if you want to disable the default local storage before implementing your
own storage solution, run:

```bash
sudo k8s disable local-storage
```

Use kubectl to interact with k8s just as you would with any other Kubernetes
cluster:

```bash
sudo k8s kubectl get pods -A
```

If you want to explore the possibilities of what you can do with Canonical
Kubernetes, be sure to check out its
[how-to guides](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/canonical-kubernetes/latest/snap/howto/)
.
