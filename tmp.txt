Created a PR for sqa builds results
Looked into CNCF tests 
    1) at least some of them were out of disk
    2) Looked into GH runners: they have prebaked tools like for android
    3) Removed them added approximately 16G to the previous 21G
    4) Now tests are generally passing
Wanted to test CNCF to see it solves the problem
    1) Created another PR to fix e2e workflow dispatch inputs
    2) Testing it right now
